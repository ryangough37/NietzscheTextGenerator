# Nietzsche Text Generator

Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Juptyer Notebooks

## Description
Used Keras for text generation using Nietzsche's work. For this project I used the writings of Nietzsche, the late-19th century German philosopher (translated to English). The language model we will learn will thus be specifically a model of Nietzsche's writing style and topics of choice, rather than a more generic model of the English language.
